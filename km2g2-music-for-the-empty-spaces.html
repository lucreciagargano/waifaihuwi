I think we can all agree Brawl Stars is a great mobile game, but the only thing I feel is missing is the lore (even though they had minuscule description for each character which were removed). That being said, I have decided to take what has been given by the game: the characters and their personalities (maybe their skins) to create a story and background for all the characters.

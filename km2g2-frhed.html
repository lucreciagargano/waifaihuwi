My Demodulation Methodology (scroll down for notes) gt!I was curious as to the contents of the tape played in that segment of the film, so !ltI wrote a very basic FSK demodulator just for this project. https://pastebin.com/9cYcVLAe (https://pastebin.com/9cYcVLAe) For this method, you will need FrHed (or a similar hex editor) and a PHP Binary.

FSHED - Funduc Software Hex Editor - a freeware hex editor we made for users of our Search and Replace, Replace Studio Pro & Replace Studio Business Edition grep utilities who needed a hex editor/viewer for use when search-replacing binary files. Inside the layer 2 leak are 3 types of files - WDM, WDN and a thumbs.db file. The WDM and WDN files appear to be files for a piece of software called Worldox, which is a document and email management program (check out the header in a hex editer like Frhed). There are thousands of these files - 4277 totalling almost 2 gigabytes. By using a data recovery program on Linux called Foremost, we can extract the data from these files.

I was playing a game with the Long Reach Research (https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Mooncat/long-reach-research) mod and was frustrated I could only place a 10x10 area of concrete. So, after some digging, I found a way around this limit. I did some reverse engineering and found a line in the binary that compares the build size to 10 to limit If you're looking for a well-designed tool to simplify your hex editing tasks, one of the apps on this list could be just what you need.

For those of you who are upset by the fix to the material duplication exploit that came with today's patch, the alternative is good 'ole cheat engine. To find the correct address to change, search for a 4 byte address. If the amount of material you have is, for example, 17.69, search for the value ' 1769 ' (just ignore the decimal!) in the 4 byte value type. Drop some material, search for the new value, pick it back up, search for the new value, and repeat until CAUTION: Frhed may overwrite files without any kind of warning message! This applies only to the "Save" function.Although I still highly recommend using Frhed, beginners should open copies of files in a separate. For purposes of my channel I had an interest in getting DK2-only apps to run in "monitor mode" - that is, at full 1080p resolution with only one eye view and without any lens distortion correction or chromatic abberation correction.

I have an idea for a simple patching program. Roughly, I'm planning on writing an app that: takes a binary file as input, searches for a specific hex edit value, and replaces it with a fixed value that I will have as a standard variable. I know enough to use a hex editing utility like FrHED manually but have no idea where to start writing a function that can do this in C++. Any resources I can look into? Don't mind using APIs as long as they can do the job without slowing Frhed is a lightweight, compact hex editor that you can run without having to install it.

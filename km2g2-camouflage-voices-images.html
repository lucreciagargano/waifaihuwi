They sat in the back of the dropship, four rows of six troopers, none of them spoke a word. Normally the back of the dropship would be filled with the platoon’s banter or at the very least some discussion about the mission ahead. Today, there was tension in the recycled air as they waited for the loadmaster to give the word. Corporal Sivan went over his weapon once more, going through the motions calmed his nerves. His hands moved almost on their own, following drills he’d done a thousand times. Рейтинг альбома Camouflage - Voices & Images (1988) и рецензии на альбом Camouflage - Voices & Images (1988).
